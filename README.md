## Back End - e-commerce
You'll need a C# software to run this, like Visual Studio for example, and set up Startup.cs and appsettings.json to get it workning for you.

## Front End - candy-store
Front end is a not very good looking React.JS app. The assignment is about the back end so time took it's toll and it is what it is.
